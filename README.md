# GMAIL Card Adder

# How to Run?
Run api.py , add your emails, cards and rotating proxies in input folder and then run the index.js

to run index.js run npm i and afterwards run node index.js

What program does it pretty simple, the program will pop browsers and login and add the cards the request that authenticates your card is intercepted and then sent to api.py which then uses proxy on only that request this way the proxy usage is way too low than the other methods and you won't face ratelimits.

if you're not on windows, change the browser executablePath in index.js line 203.
